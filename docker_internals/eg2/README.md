Warning! this example "might" get your system crashed, if that happened, su to root and do "mount -t proc proc /proc" should solve the problem
But anyway, please make sure all files are saved properly before you start to play with this example.

sudo go run namespace.go

instead the namespace: mount -t proc proc /proc
